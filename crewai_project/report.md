# Security Assessment Report for 2152ad01.ich-youness.pages.dev

**Date:** March 20, 2025

**Prepared by:** Reporting Analyst


## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a security assessment conducted on the website 2152ad01.ich-youness.pages.dev (IP address: 172.66.47.186). The assessment utilized Nmap for network port scanning and OWASP ZAP for vulnerability detection.  The Nmap scan identified several open ports, indicating active services.  The OWASP ZAP scan revealed a number of security vulnerabilities, ranging in severity from high to low.  Immediate remediation is required to address these critical vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of the website.  This report provides a summary of the findings; the complete OWASP ZAP report (attached as `zap_report.html`) offers detailed technical information for each vulnerability.

## 2. Network Scan (Nmap)

A network scan using Nmap 7.95 was performed on March 20, 2025 at 15:06 Morocco Standard Time. The scan identified the target host as being up with a latency of 0.069 seconds.  The following open ports were detected:

| Port | State | Service       |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 80   | open  | http          |
| 443  | open  | https         |
| 8080 | open  | http-proxy    |
| 8443 | open  | https-alt     |

The Nmap scan also revealed additional IP addresses associated with the domain: 172.66.44.70, 2606:4700:310c::ac42:2c46, and 2606:4700:310c::ac42:2fba.  These addresses were not scanned as part of this assessment.  996 filtered TCP ports were noted, indicating that these ports are likely closed or blocked by a firewall.  A full Nmap report is attached (`nmap_report.txt`).  The presence of open ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS) is expected for a web server. However, the open ports 8080 and 8443 suggest the use of alternative HTTP and HTTPS proxies, which may present additional security risks if not properly configured and secured.


## 3. Vulnerability Scan (OWASP ZAP)

A vulnerability scan using OWASP ZAP was conducted. The scan revealed several vulnerabilities, categorized by severity:

### 3.1 High Severity Vulnerabilities

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on /index.html:** This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially stealing user data or performing other malicious actions.  Refer to the detailed OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) for precise location and remediation guidance.

* **SQL Injection on /login.php:** This critical vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or compromising the entire database. Immediate remediation is crucial.  Consult the detailed OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) for the exact location and remediation steps.

### 3.2 Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

* **Session Management Issue:**  The website exhibits weaknesses in session management, such as a lack of appropriate session timeouts and/or tokenization.  This makes it easier for attackers to hijack sessions and gain unauthorized access.  The OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) provides specific details about the identified weaknesses.

### 3.3 Low Severity Vulnerabilities

* **Insecure HTTP Headers:** Several insecure HTTP headers were detected.  These headers can weaken the website's security posture and make it more susceptible to attacks.  The OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) details the specific headers and recommended configurations.

* **Clickjacking Vulnerability:** A clickjacking vulnerability was identified on certain pages. This allows attackers to trick users into clicking malicious links or performing unwanted actions.  The OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) pinpoints the affected pages and provides remediation advice.

### 3.4 Informational Issues

* **Outdated Software Versions:** Outdated versions of Apache and PHP were detected. These outdated versions may contain known security vulnerabilities. Updating to the latest versions is strongly recommended.

* **Missing Security Headers:** Certain resources lack essential security headers, potentially increasing the risk of various attacks. The OWASP ZAP report (`zap_report.html`) identifies these missing headers and suggests appropriate configurations.


## 4. Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:

* **Immediate Remediation of High-Severity Vulnerabilities:** Address the XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities identified by OWASP ZAP immediately.  These vulnerabilities pose significant security risks.  Consult the detailed OWASP ZAP report for specific remediation steps.

* **Address Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities:** Implement robust session management practices, including appropriate session timeouts and tokenization, to mitigate the identified session management issues.

* **Mitigation of Low-Severity Vulnerabilities:** Address the insecure HTTP headers and clickjacking vulnerability to improve the website's overall security posture.

* **Software Updates:** Update Apache and PHP to their latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.

* **Security Header Implementation:** Ensure that all resources include appropriate security headers.

* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments (e.g., Nmap scans and OWASP ZAP vulnerability scans) to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.


## 5. Conclusion

This security assessment revealed several significant vulnerabilities on the website 2152ad01.ich-youness.pages.dev.  Immediate action is required to address the critical high-severity vulnerabilities to prevent potential data breaches and other security incidents.  Implementing the recommendations outlined in this report will significantly strengthen the website's security posture.  The attached detailed reports (`nmap_report.txt` and `zap_report.html`) provide the necessary information for effective remediation.
