# Reconnaissance Report: dr-keller-pierre.chirurgiens-dentistes.fr

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** Reconnaissance Scan Results and Security Assessment


This report details the findings from a reconnaissance scan conducted on the domain dr-keller-pierre.chirurgiens-dentistes.fr.  The scan utilized several tools including Sublist3r, WHOIS lookup, DNSRecon, and Nmap.  The results reveal several aspects of the target's infrastructure and potential security vulnerabilities.


## 1. Subdomain Enumeration (Sublist3r)

Sublist3r identified only one subdomain: `www.dr-keller-pierre.chirurgiens-dentistes.fr`.  This limited discovery may indicate a lack of aggressive subdomain usage, or limitations in the Sublist3r tool's effectiveness against this target.  Further investigation using alternative subdomain enumeration tools might be beneficial to ascertain a more comprehensive inventory of potential subdomains.  The incompleteness of these results warrants further investigation using alternative tools and techniques.  This should be prioritized in future scans.


## 2. WHOIS Lookup

The WHOIS lookup for dr-keller-pierre.chirurgiens-dentistes.fr yielded no results.  This lack of information could indicate that the domain registration information is intentionally obscured using privacy services, or that there may be an error in the WHOIS data. The absence of WHOIS data hinders efforts to identify the domain registrar, registrant contact information, and other relevant registration details. This information gap will have to be addressed via other means.


## 3. DNS Record Analysis (DNSRecon)

DNSRecon returned a variety of DNS records, including NS (nameservers), SOA (start of authority), MX (mail exchangers), A (address), and TXT (text) records.  This information provides valuable insights into the target's DNS infrastructure and mail server configuration.  The specific details of these records are not included here due to their length and complexity but warrant attention in determining the overall security posture of the website's DNS infrastructure.  Specifically, the configuration of the Name Servers, Mail Exchanger records, and any TXT records related to security protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) will require careful inspection.  Analysis of these records should be performed to identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.


## 4. Port Scanning and Service Versioning (Nmap)

The Nmap scan revealed the presence of several open ports and services:

* **HTTP (port 80):** Indicates a web server is running on this port.
* **HTTPS (port 443):**  Indicates a secure web server is running on this port.
* **FTP (port 21):**  The presence of an FTP server poses a significant security risk if not properly secured.
* **SSH (port 22):**  The SSH service is commonly used for secure remote access.
* **SMTP (ports 25 and 465):** These ports are used for sending emails.  The presence of both ports might indicate redundancy or different email sending methods.
* **POP3 (ports 110 and 995):**  Ports used for retrieving emails.  The presence of both ports implies different security configurations (unencrypted vs. SSL/TLS).
* **IMAP (ports 143 and 993):**  Ports used for accessing emails.  Again, the presence of both suggests varied security levels.
* **MySQL (port 3306):**  Indicates a MySQL database server is running.  This database likely stores critical data; its security is paramount.

Nmap also provided version information for many of these services.  This detail is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities based on known exploits and security advisories associated with specific service versions.  The specific version numbers should be cataloged for further investigation in later penetration testing stages.   The SSL certificates were also examined, and the validity periods of each certificate were obtained. Expiring certificates require immediate attention to prevent service interruptions.

The server's operating system was identified (using Nmap's OS detection capabilities), and it was found to be running Apache web server software.  This information is useful for targeting vulnerabilities specific to Apache and its configuration. The large number of open ports is a significant security concern.  Further investigation is required to determine if these open ports are necessary or represent a misconfiguration that could expose the system to vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

This reconnaissance phase has identified several areas of concern:

* **Limited Subdomain Discovery:** Further subdomain enumeration is recommended.
* **Absence of WHOIS Information:** Investigate methods to obtain registration information.
* **Numerous Open Ports:**  A detailed security assessment is required to determine the necessity of each open port and mitigate any potential risks.  Port hardening and firewall rules should be revisited.
* **Service Versioning:**  Update services to the latest stable versions to address known vulnerabilities.
* **SSL Certificate Validity:**  Monitor certificate expiration dates and renew them as needed to avoid service disruption.

This report serves as a foundation for further investigation. A more in-depth security assessment, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, is highly recommended to comprehensively identify and address potential security risks.  The information gathered here provides a strong starting point for such an assessment.
